- properly draw tree structures from training set
	use camera snapshot for reference, ultimately this is best presented with a diagramming tool (ie. MS Visio)
	make sure the tree structures are validated
		f.e. create indented and newline separated bracketting formatted trees (see \trunk\NLP_Assignment2\NLP_Assignment2\res\txt)
- gather all discussion of questions in a report
- answer discussion questions
	explain parse results (at least half a page)
- run Evalb
	analyze overall summary
		precision, recall, f1-measure
			look up the definition of these metrics!
- remove /res/img/cam as many of the images are erroneous (alternatively replace the images with correct ones)
	best to replace these with diagrams, both in native format for the diagramming tool and as jpeg/png exports

- fully implement runall.bat
	to fetch lexicon & grammar files from the project and run bitpar --> post-process --> evalb (while also moving around those I/O files)
- edit repo log message

- check if fixing tabs spacing bug for grammar fields produces a less erroneous bitpar output
- bitpar crashes at the last two lines of grammar & lexicon files (which describe the total number of unique rules?)
