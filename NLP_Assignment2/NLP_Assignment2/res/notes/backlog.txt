- properly draw tree structures from training set
	use camera snapshot for reference, ultimately this is best presented with a diagramming tool (ie. MS Visio)
	make sure the tree structures are validated
		f.e. create indented and newline separated bracketting formatted trees (see \trunk\NLP_Assignment2\NLP_Assignment2\res\txt)
- gather all discussion of questions in a report
- answer discussion questions
	explain parse results (at least half a page)
- run Evalb
	analyze overall summary
		precision, recall, f1-measure
			look up the definition of these metrics!

<< extra >>
- fully implement runall.bat
	to fetch lexicon & grammar files from the project and run bitpar --> post-process --> evalb (while also moving around those I/O files)
