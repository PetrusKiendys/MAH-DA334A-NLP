- properly draw tree structures from training set
	use camera snapshot for reference, ultimately this is best presented with a diagramming tool (ie. MS Visio)
	make sure the tree structures are validated
		f.e. create indented and newline separated bracketting formatted trees (see \trunk\NLP_Assignment2\NLP_Assignment2\res\txt)
- gather all discussion of questions in a report
	this could also be done in a simple textfile but a rich text format report is good for presenting parse trees etc.
- extract a lexicon and a grammar file (involves coding)
- answer discussion questions
	consider Algorithm 1 and comment on it
	quantity of rules extracted from [pos-cfg] and [dep-cfg]
		need to fully implement a grammar and lexicon file extractor to answer this...
	explain parse results (at least half a page)
- run BitPar and analyze output
- run Python/Perl script
	look up how to run it
	also open the script itself and analyze what it does (to get an understanding of what we're doing...)
- run Evalb
	analyze overall summary
		precision, recall, f1-measure
			look up the definition of these metrics!
