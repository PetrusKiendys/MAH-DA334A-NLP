- properly draw tree structures from training set
	save these in native format and also as exported images (.vpp for Visual Paradigm, ??? for MS Visio)
	use camera snapshot for reference, ultimately this is best presented with a diagramming tool (ie. MS Visio, even Visual Paradigm works...)
		remove /res/img/cam as many of the images are erroneous (alternatively replace the images with correct ones)
	make sure the tree structures are validated
		refer to indented and newline separated bracketting formatted trees (see \trunk\NLP_Assignment2\NLP_Assignment2\res\txt)

- fully implement runall.bat
	to fetch lexicon & grammar files from the project and run bitpar --> post-process --> evalb (while also moving around those I/O files)
